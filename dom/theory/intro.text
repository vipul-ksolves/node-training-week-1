## What is the DOM?
The DOM stands for Document Object Model. It can simply be understood as a tree of nodes 
created by the browser. Each of these nodes has its own properties and methods 
which can be manipulated using JavaScript.

The ability to manipulate the DOM is one of the most unique and useful abilities of 
JavaScript.
